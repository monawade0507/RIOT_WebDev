        Introduction
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        As the end of the season approaches, baseball fans like to engage in
        speculation about which teams will advance to the post season and whether
        their favorite team is still in contention for a playoff berth.
        Newspapers frequently run headlines in their sports sections declaring
        that a particular team has been eliminated from contention or that the
        first place team has clinched a playoff berth. These determinations can
        often be made by looking at the standings and making a few simple
        calculations. The RIOT baseball standings can actually tell you when a
        team has locked up a playoff spot or fallen out of contention days
        before it is reported anywhere else!
        <br>
        <br>
        The key is taking into account the actual matchups that remain in the season and
        enumerating all possible outcomes. Until the final weeks of the season, however,
        the number of possible outcomes can be astronomically large, which makes such an
        enumeration impractical even on a very fast computer. By using a powerful and
        pervasive analytics technique called Network Optimization, it is possible to
        accurately perform the necessary calculations without explicitly enumerating
        all possibilities. Consequently, it is possible for RIOT to determine the playoff
        prospects of a team a few days, or even weeks, before it is reported by the
        popular media. The following example, using the American League standings on the
        morning of Wednesday, September 5, 2012 shows how this works.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        AL East
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        Since Baltimore and New York are tied for first place in the AL East
        with identical records, neither team has a <a style="color:blue" href="faq.html">traditionally calculated magic number</a>
        . However, if either team wins 26 of their remaining 27
        games, they will clinch first place. This is because they still have
        a four-game series left on the schedule. For example, suppose Baltimore
        wins 26 more games. That would have to include at least three wins
        against New York. The final win totals in this scenario would be 102
        for Baltimore, and at most 100 for New York. Therefore, RIOT reports
        that Baltimore has a first place clinch number of 26. Using the same
        logic, New York's first place clinch number is also 26.
        <br>
        <br>
        Tampa Bay does not have a traditional magic number because they are
        not in first place. However, they have a four-game series left with
        New York, and a six-game series left with Baltimore. If they win all
        26 of their remaining games, then they will win the division with 101
        wins while New York has at most 99 wins and Baltimore has at most 97.
        Therefore, RIOT reports that Tampa Bay's first place clinch number is 26.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        AL Central
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        Chicago can clinch first place in the AL Central with 100 wins because
        Detroit's best possible win total at end of the season is 72+27 = 99.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since Chicago already has 73 wins, their traditionally calculated
        magic number is 100 - 73 = 27.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's easy to see that Chicago can clinch first place by winning all 27
        of their remaining games, but they really only need to win 25 to clinch
        because they still have a four-game series with Detroit left on their
        schedule. If they split that series, and both teams win all of their
        other remaining games, then Chicago will finish the season with 98 wins
        to Detroit's 97. Therefore, RIOT reports that Chicago's first place
        clinch number is 25.
        <br>
        <br>
        If Detroit wins 26 of their remaining 27 games, that would have to
        at least three wins against Chicago. In this scenario, Detroit would
        win the division with 98 wins while Chicago would finish the season
        with at most 97. Therefore, Detroit's first place clinch number is 26.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        AL West
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        Texas can clinch first place in the AL West with 104 wins because
        Oakland's best possible win total at the end of the season is
        76+27 = 103.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since Texas already has 80 wins, their traditionally calculated magic
        number is 104 - 80 = 24.
        <br>
        <br>
        But, Texas really only needs to win 22 more games to clinch the division
        because they still have a seven-game series against Oakland left on their
        schedule. If they win 22 out of their remaining 27 games, that would
        have to include at least two wins against Oakland. The final win totals
        in this scenario would be 102 for Texas, and at most 101 for Oakland.
        Therefore, RIOT reports that Texas has a first place clinch number of 22.
        Using similar logic, RIOT reports that Oakland's first place clinch
        number is 26.
        <br>
        <br>
        In another example, RIOT's standings page for the National League on the
        morning of August 30, 2012 showed that Houston had already been
        eliminated from the playoffs even though it wasn't obvious from their
        won-lost record.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        NL East
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        NL Central
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        NL West
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        It is easy to see from the standings above that Houston is eliminated
        from first place in the NL Central. If Houston were to win all 32 of
        their remaining games, they would finish with 72 wins. But, Cincinnati
        has already won 80 games; so no matter what else happens in the season,
        Cincinnati will finish ahead of Houston in the NL Central. However, the
        fact that Houston has also been eliminated from reaching the postseason
        as a wild card team is not readily apparent from the standings.
        <br>
        <br>
        Since Washington, Atlanta, Cincinnati, and San Francisco already have
        better records than Houston, their only chance for the playoffs is to
        clinch the second wild card spot. St. Louis is currently in the lead for
        that spot with 71 wins. Since Houston still has a chance, however remote,
        of finishing the season with 72 wins, it looks as though they could
        still make the postseason as a wild card team. A closer look at the
        schedule, however, reveals that even a miracle winning streak would not
        allow Houston to make the playoffs.
        <br>
        <br>
        Los Angeles, who have 70 wins so far, and St. Louis still have a
        four-game series to play before the end of season. There are no ties in
        baseball, which means that at least one of these teams will finish with
        at least 73 wins. If St. Louis wins two or more games in the series,
        then they will finish the season with at least 73 wins; and if they win
        one or zero of those games, then Los Angeles will finish with at least
        73 wins. Either way, Houston is eliminated from the playoffs because
        there will be at least five teams in the National League with better
        records at the end of the season.
        <br>
        <br>
        Determining that a particular team has been eliminated can often be much
        more difficult than it is in this example. Follow <a style="color:blue" href="coming_soon.html">this link</a> for a more
        complicated example involving all the teams in the American League East.

        Optimization Details
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        Calculating the clinching and elimination numbers for the RIOT baseball
        standings involves systematically searching for scenarios in which
        particular teams finish with or without gaining playoff berths. For
        example, we determined that San Francisco was eliminated from first
        place in the National League West on September 8th by proving that no
        feasible scenario exists in which the Giants win the division. The
        problem of determining whether a team can advance to playoffs given the
        current league standings and schedule of remaining games can be solved
        by a single maximum flow calculation (see Hoffman and Rivlin [1] and
        Schwartz [2]). By introducing additional constraints, we extend this
        maximum flow formulation to derive integer linear programming problems
        which find the minimum number of games a given team must win to clinch
        a playoff spot or avoid elimination from post season play. Robinson [3]
        takes a similar approach to finding a scenario which maximizes a given
        team's lead in the final standings. Interested readers should also
        consult Gusfield and Martel [4], who show how to find the minimum number
        of games a team must win to avoid elimination from first place by solving
        a parametric minimum cut problem.
